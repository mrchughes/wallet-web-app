| Security | 25% Complete | Encryption, signature verification, phishing protection | High |
| PDS Integration | 40% Complete | Permissions, cross-pod sharing, data portability | High |
| Presentation | 20% Complete | ZKP, VP generation, QR codes, request handling | High |
| Integration | 15% Complete | Issuer/verifier integration, protocols, gov services | Medium |

## Critical Gaps Analysis

### Highest Priority Gaps

1. **Security Fundamentals**
   - Local encryption for sensitive data
   - Secure key storage
   - Complete signature verification

2. **Core Functionality**
   - Complete DID:ION implementation
   - Enhanced credential storage in PDS
   - Solid OIDC authentication improvements

3. **User Requirements**
   - Selective disclosure of credential attributes
   - Verifiable presentation generation
   - Issuer and verifier integration

## Technical Debt

Several areas of the codebase have accumulated technical debt that should be addressed alongside the functional gaps:

1. **Architecture Issues**
   - Inconsistent error handling
   - Limited test coverage
   - Tight coupling between components

2. **Code Quality**
   - Inconsistent coding patterns
   - Limited documentation
   - Performance optimizations needed

3. **Dependency Management**
   - Outdated libraries
   - Security vulnerabilities in dependencies
   - Inconsistent versioning strategy

## Quick Wins

The following gaps could be addressed relatively quickly with high impact:

1. **DID Management**
   - Complete DID:ION creation with service endpoints

2. **Credential Management**
   - Implement basic revocation checking

3. **User Interface**
   - Enhance credential visualization templates

4. **Security**
   - Implement basic signature verification for additional signature types

5. **Presentation**
   - Add QR code generation for credential sharing

## Long-term Challenges

These gaps represent significant technical challenges that will require more time and expertise:

1. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**
   - Implementation complexity
   - Performance considerations
   - Limited library support

2. **Cross-Pod Sharing**
   - Protocol standardization issues
   - Security considerations
   - User experience challenges

3. **Government Service Integration**
   - Compliance requirements
   - Country-specific variations
   - Certification processes

## Standards Compliance

The current implementation has varying levels of compliance with relevant standards:

| Standard | Compliance Level | Gaps |
|----------|------------------|------|
| W3C Verifiable Credentials | Partial | Selective disclosure, ZKP, multi-format support |
| W3C Decentralized Identifiers | Partial | DID document management, verification methods |
| Solid OIDC | Partial | DPoP, token refresh, dynamic registration |
| DIF Presentation Exchange | Minimal | Request/response formats, credential manifests |
| FIDO2/WebAuthn | Not Implemented | Biometric authentication, hardware security keys |

## Integration Assessment

The wallet has limited integration with external systems:

1. **Issuer Integration**
   - No standard protocol support
   - Manual credential import only
   - No issuer discovery

2. **Verifier Integration**
   - Basic presentation generation
   - No standard verification protocols
   - Limited presentation request handling

3. **PDS Integration**
   - Basic data storage and retrieval
   - Limited permissions model
   - No cross-pod functionality

4. **External Service Integration**
   - No government service integration
   - Limited integration with identity providers
   - No support for regulated credential types
